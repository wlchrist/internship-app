# Sprint 1 Report 
Video Link: 
## What's New (User Facing)
 * Real-time Computer Science internship listings from Fantastic Jobs API
 * Comprehensive filtering for CS roles (Software Engineering, Data Science, AI/ML, etc.)
 * Modern, responsive web interface with internship cards
 * Auto-refresh functionality every 24 hours
 * Manual refresh button for immediate data updates
 * Smart filtering that excludes non-CS positions (accounting, finance, marketing)
 * Detailed internship information including company, location, salary, and requirements

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
Our team successfully built a full-stack internship aggregator application from scratch, integrating with the Fantastic Jobs API via RapidAPI to fetch real Computer Science internship data. We overcame several technical challenges including API response parsing, CORS configuration, virtual environment setup, and filtering logic implementation. The backend uses FastAPI with Python 3.13, while the frontend leverages Next.js 15.5.4 with React 19.1.0 and Tailwind CSS. We implemented comprehensive query parameters to target CS-specific roles and developed robust error handling with fallback to mock data when API limits are reached. The application successfully fetches and displays 7+ real internship postings with proper filtering and transformation of API responses to our internal data models.

## Unfinished Work
All planned features for this sprint have been completed successfully. The application is fully functional with real API integration, comprehensive filtering, and a polished user interface.

## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
  * Successful integration with external API (Fantastic Jobs API via RapidAPI)
  * Clean separation of concerns between frontend and backend
  * Comprehensive filtering logic for CS-specific internships
  * Robust error handling with fallback mechanisms
  * Modern, responsive UI with Tailwind CSS
  * Complete documentation and setup instructions
  * Effective use of TypeScript for type safety
  * Automated startup scripts for easy development setup

Here's what we'd like to improve:
   * API rate limiting handling could be more sophisticated
   * Could add more detailed error messages for debugging
   * Consider adding pagination for large result sets
   * Add more comprehensive testing coverage
   * Implement caching to reduce API calls
   * Add user authentication and saved searches

Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
   * Add user authentication and personalized internship tracking
   * Implement advanced search and filtering options
   * Add email notifications for new matching internships
   * Integrate additional job board APIs for broader coverage
   * Add internship application tracking features
   * Implement user feedback and rating system
   * Add mobile app development
   * Enhance data analytics and reporting features
